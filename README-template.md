# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). 

### My technique
It's a simple column card. So I used plain HTML and CSS Flexbox to be specific.

### Difficulties faced
I struggled a bit to set the appropriate height of the card which I managed to solve by setting a min-height. Poisitoning the buttons at appropriate margin was also a bit tricky for me and I had to manually set the middle button at place. I'm sure there is a better workaround for this. But for the time being, it works well

### What I learnt
I previously didn't know that you only need to modify the pieces of stylesheet that will change based on screen size and not repeat the whole stylesheet with the changes. I did that in this challenge.
